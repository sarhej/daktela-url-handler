## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why do I see a dialog?
**A:** Windows protects you from malware by requiring your permission before changing app handlers. Click through once, and it's done forever.

### Q: Do I need admin rights?
**A:** Yes, only for installation (one time). Daily use doesn't need admin.

### Q: Is it safe?
**A:** Yes! It just tells Windows to use Daktela for phone links. Completely safe.

### Q: What if I get an error?
**A:** Run the installer again with "Run as Administrator".

### Q: Can I undo it?
**A:** Yes, but it requires IT help. Contact your IT admin if needed.

### Q: What if a different app opens?
**A:** Another app might have been set as default. Just run the installer again.

### Q: Can I test it without clicking a real number?
**A:** Yes! Use `test-links.html` which has test numbers that won't actually dial.
